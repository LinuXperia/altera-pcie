Various IP blocks. You can do the required generation (& optional ModelSim compilation) using the
build.sh script: run it without args to generate only; run it with "-c" to also compile. You will
not be able to do any simulation if you do not compile. The compiled libraries are placed in a
"sim-libs" subdir.
