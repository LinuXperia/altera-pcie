Various utility functions and procedures.

log2(N):
  Return the number of bits required to represent N states. Basically int(ceil(log2(N, 2))). N is
  of type natural, so N >= 2 and N <= 2^31-1.

ternary(c, x, y):
  Return (natural) x if c=true, else return y. Useful for initialization of constants, with
  generic-based conditions.

from_*():
  Accept chars, return std_logic_vector of various widths.

to_*():
  Accept std_logic_vector of various widths, return a char.
